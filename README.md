##Project Introduction
This is a machine learning based project focused on exploring different models and data processing techniques.

##project structure
Â·data preparation/` -include data preprocessing
`data/` - include original dataset ( already use Git LFS manage large data)
`feature extraction/` - include feature extraction
`model/` - include different machine learning model
\new-data/` - include new dataset after data preprocessing

##Install and Execute
Install code:
Unzip the zip file

Install data:
Download data from https://foreverdata.org/1015/index.html: Release 1 ZIP (7MB), Release 2 ZIP (46MB), Release 3 ZIP (52MB).
After decompression, save all data in a folder, rename the data folder to `data`.
 Place this `data` folder alongside the following directories: - `data preparation` - `feature extraction` - `model`

Install dependencies:
Install sklearn
Install pandas
Install numpy 
Install matplotlib

Execution Order
To properly run the project, please follow these steps:
**Run `data preparation`**: Start by running the scripts in the `data preparation` folder to prepare the raw data.
 **Run `feature extraction`**: After the data is prepared, proceed to the `feature extraction` folder to extract the necessary features from the data.
**Run `model`**: Finally, run the scripts in the `model` folder to build and evaluate the model using the extracted features.
